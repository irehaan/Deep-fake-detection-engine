The term "deep fake" typically refers to synthesized media, often manipulated images or videos created using deep learning techniques. In the context of this model, a "deep fake detection engine" aims to identify such manipulated content. The model utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms and neural networks, including InceptionResnetV1 for feature extraction and MTCNN for face detection, to analyze images and distinguish between authentic and manipulated ones. By examining subtle cues and anomalies in the data, the model aims to flag potentially deceptive content, contributing to efforts to combat the spread of misinformation and protect the integrity of digital media.
